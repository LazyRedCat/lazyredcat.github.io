            "Twenty years ago today, Opera’s CTO Håkon Wium Lie published
            Cascading HTML style sheets – a proposal. If Paul McCartney were a
            web developer, and writing ‘Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club
            Band’ today, he would almost certainly write:

          <p id="verse">
            It was twenty years ago today<br />
            That Håkon wrote a doc to say<br />
            That if the Web’s gonna last a while<br />
            Then we need a way to define style.<br />
            So may I introduce to you a way to add visual treats:<br />
